## True Or False Color ([trueorfalsecolor.com] (http://trueorfalsecolor.com))
[True Or False Color] (http://trueorfalsecolor.com) is a game inspired by the Stroop effect. You need to check if the name of the written color matches with the color displayed.

The Stroop effect is a demonstration of interference in the reaction time of a task. When the name of a color is printed in a color not denoted by the name, naming the color of the word takes longer and is more prone to errors than when the color of the ink matches the name of the color. The effect is named after John Ridley Stroop, who first published the effect in English in 1935 in an article entitled "Studies of interference in serial verbal reactions" that includes three different experiments.
